# Black Lives Matter Database

A repository to aid in awareness and transparency surrounding black lives taken by police over the last 5 years. 

This summer has been important for raising awareness around black lives lost at the hands of police, in the spirit of honoring these souls and allowing thier memories to live on I've created this project.

In order to begin:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `yarn start` and `yarn run db` commands to bring up the local application and source database.
3. After beginning the application navigate to the Edit Page and create a username in order to gain access to records.
4. Contact me for admin access in order to gain access to the GraphQL API.

A working baseline for the application has been established, but there are opportunities available for contributors of all skill levels even those without coding knowledge!
